# auto-dark-mode

**Note:** As of VSCode 1.42, there are [native user settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_42#_auto-switch-theme-based-on-os-color-scheme) you can use to simulate the `darkTheme` and `lightTheme` options. This extension is still handy for switching between icon themes though.

Automatically switch between light and dark themes depending on the system dark mode toggle.

Currently only the macOS & Windows platforms are supported.

## Configuration

The extension exposes four configuration fields for you to select a dark and a light theme.

- `autoDarkMode.darkTheme` - Specifies which theme is to be shown when dark mode is on
- `autoDarkMode.lightTheme` - Specifies which theme is to be shown when dark mode is off
- `autoDarkMode.darkIconTheme` - Specifies which icon theme is to be shown when dark mode is on (optional)
- `autoDarkMode.lightIconTheme` - Specifies which icon theme is to be shown when dark mode is off (optional)

## Status

This extension is under heavy development, and is not stable.
